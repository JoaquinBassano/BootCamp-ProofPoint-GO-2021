# BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021

Welcome to this repository where we will find the main concepts and a simple web application in the GO programming language. These concepts were learned in the following Udemy course: [Learn Go for Beginners Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-language-crash-course/)

Most of the concepts learned in the course are exemplified with a small console application. 

[CONCEPTS](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Basic-Concepts):
* [Variables](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Basic-Concepts/Variables)
* [Scopes](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Basic-Concepts/Scope)
* [Third Party Packages](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Basic-Concepts/Console-App) 
* Data Types: 

    - Basic (int, float, string, bool) 
    - Aggregate (arrays, structs)
    - Reference (pointers, slices, maps, functions, [channels](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Basic-Concepts/Channels))
    - [Interface Type](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Basic-Concepts/Interfaces)
* Expressions
* Composition
* Flow Control
* [If/Else, Switch and Select](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Basic-Concepts/IF%20with%20Game)
* Operators
* [Strings](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Basic-Concepts/String-Interpolation)

Then, several learned concepts are applied to the construction of a [simple web application](https://github.com/JoaquinBassano/BootCamp-ProofPoint-GO-2021/tree/main/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20Web%20Application) that allows you to play rock, paper or scissors.
